I am inviting users sunday afternoon at 3pm PST no matter what. 

Today: 
do a critical walkthrough - create onboarding and links
deploy to heroku
create some workouts
send out the link to friends

Next:
comments on workout
create my last few workouts on my own page in heroku - set a programmatic example

have a nice explanation of site and on boarding experience - this should take the remainder of your time. Assume very few will use it once and almost no one will use it twice, make it extremely intuitive. 

Styleguide: 


On Boarding:
The best on boarding would be examples to point to that are easy to understand and immediately actionable/effective
I need to make sure I have links accessible to examples as often as needed

polish:
there are opportunities to include Font Awesome on the workout show page
There are opportunities for dramatic styling improvements on the styleguide
validate presence of user profile picture
create the link for setting a profile pic if its washed away on heroku
this site looks pretty good though

Two goals - this is my vision
User can create a workout with text description and comments

Comments belong to user
t.string content
t.datetime posting_date (to sentence or w/e)

Next Steps:
user can search for workouts by tags
