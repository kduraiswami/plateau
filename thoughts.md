I am committed to figuring out the nested routes for creating comments on workouts first. has_many_through? I will try my best on this tomorrow

Then I will create nested routes to ask for feedback on a particular workout or exercise


polish:
there are opportunities to include Font Awesome on the workout show page
There are opportunities for dramatic styling improvements on the styleguide
validate presence of user profile picture
create the link for setting a profile pic if its washed away on heroku
this site looks pretty good though

Two goals - this is my vision
User can create a workout with text description and comments

Comments belong to user
t.string content
t.datetime posting_date (to sentence or w/e)

Next Steps:
user can search for workouts by tags
