User Has many Workouts
//User has many Feedbacks

// not sure yet, this is not my vision but I care about helping my friends and this just may not be something I am used to. I can make the experience good enough to change my own behavior too. 
Feedback belongs to user
Feedback has many comments
t.string photo or video 
 
Comments belong to user
t.string content
t.datetime posting_date (to sentence or w/e)

NEXT: 
can a user successfully reset a password right now
what is the best about page possible
how should a user contact me right now with feedback or problems
what is the display of the blank home page going to include?
What is the link to create a work out and / or post look like on the home page (blue button for workout, green button for feedback)
how do I create an embedded youtube player on posts on the site
Do I need a special syntax for exercise routes that are going to be on the same form as a workout route? 
What do I want this to be most simply? 



Workflow: 
I will see a picture to the left
Beneath this picture I will see the basic information about this person
(this profile section will resemble github)

to the right of the picture I will see a button link to create a new workout if I am on my page
on other users the section to the right will show tiled workout summaries displayed in a uniform size
The summary tile says the goal, estimated time and gym style 
The issue with this tile is I cannot tell if a workout is "good" or not from the simple view- maybe color coded tiles depending on ratings, but maybe I just need the ideas for now
I can click on these workouts and be taken to its show page and look at the details of the workout exercises
I care about the source of the idea a lot - it will make sense to get very fit people on this site that have good ideas.
