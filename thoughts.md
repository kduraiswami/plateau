//User has many Feedbacks

// not sure yet, this is not my vision but I care about helping my friends and this just may not be something I am used to. I can make the experience good enough to change my own behavior too.

Two goals - this is my vision
User can upload their own personal profile picture from local device

User can create a workout
user can see a feed of all workouts created

user can search for workouts by tags (next) 

Workflow: 
I will see a picture to the left
Beneath this picture I will see the basic information about this person
(this profile section will resemble github)

to the right of the picture I will see a button link to create a new workout if I am on my page
on other users the section to the right will show tiled workout summaries displayed in a uniform size
The summary tile says the goal, estimated time and gym style 
The issue with this tile is I cannot tell if a workout is "good" or not from the simple view- maybe color coded tiles depending on ratings, but maybe I just need the ideas for now
I can click on these workouts and be taken to its show page and look at the details of the workout exercises
I care about the source of the idea a lot - it will make sense to get very fit people on this site that have good ideas.
