This site is to post and exchange workout routines as well as gain feedback about your form and exercise ideas. The hope from this community is to improve our fitness results. Please use this site to get ideas about what to do and how to improve! <br><br>

The dream for this would be to create a community that would help users create great workouts and efficiently monitor and share exercise performance. This service could be a simple location for weightlifting routines or specialized training for various sports or events (tough mudder, triathlon, etc.) In its greatest form it could also aggregate and track user performance during workouts from user reporting or wearable device reporting. This data could be used to recommend workouts or opportunities for physical improvement.
